# Atliq Bank Project

Atliq Bank, a leading financial institution, wants to launch a new credit card to compete with other banks in India. To address this, they collected relevant data and executed the project in two phases:
📂 Phase-1: Identify the target market
📂 Phase-2: Conduct a trial run using Hypothesis Testing

## Skills gained
- **Data cleaning**
- **EDA**
- **Data visualization**


## Project Explanation
Phase-1: Target Market Analysis
🔍 Key Steps Taken:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning:
Replaced missing values using techniques like mean, median, and mode based on the context.
Addressed outliers effectively with the IQR method to ensure clean and reliable data.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted in-depth analysis using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns.
Tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn helped transform raw data into meaningful insights.
📌 Outcome:
Through extensive analysis, I identified the lower age group as the ideal target market for launching the new credit card.

Phase-2: Trial Run (Hypothesis Testing)
💡 Steps Followed:
1️⃣ Campaign Planning:
Defined two groups:
🔹 Target Group: Received the new credit card, and data was collected post-campaign.
🔹 Control Group: Continued with the old credit card, and data was also collected.

3️⃣ Hypothesis Testing:
Null Hypothesis (H0): The new credit card has less impact than the old credit card.
Alternate Hypothesis (H1): The new credit card has more impact than the old credit card.

🔬 Steps in Hypothesis Testing:
1. Set up statistical power and effect size for the campaign.
2. Visualized data distributions to observe trends.
3. Computed the Z-score and compared it to the critical Z-score at a 5% significance level.

📌 Outcome:
The analysis yielded a Z-score > Z-critical, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. 🎉
This means the new credit card performed better than the old credit card, confirming its success!
