# Atliq Bank Project

Atliq Bank, a leading financial institution, wants to launch a new credit card to compete with other banks in India. To address this, they collected relevant data and executed the project in two phases:
- **Phase-1**: Identify the target market
- **Phase-2**: Conduct a trial run using Hypothesis Testing

## Skills gained
- **Data cleaning**
- **EDA**
- **Data visualization**


## Project Explanation
Phase-1: Target Market Analysis
🔍 Key Steps Taken:
- **Data Cleaning**:
Replaced missing values using techniques like mean, median, and mode based on the context.
Addressed outliers effectively with the IQR method to ensure clean and reliable data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
Conducted in-depth analysis using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns.
Tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn helped transform raw data into meaningful insights.

- **Outcome**:
Through extensive analysis, I identified the lower age group as the ideal target market for launching the new credit card.

Phase-2: Trial Run (Hypothesis Testing)
💡 Steps Followed:
- **Campaign Planning**:
Defined two groups:
- **Target Group**: Received the new credit card, and data was collected post-campaign.
- **Control Group**: Continued with the old credit card, and data was also collected.

- **Hypothesis Testing**:
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The new credit card has less impact than the old credit card.
- **Alternate Hypothesis (H1)**: The new credit card has more impact than the old credit card.

- **Steps in Hypothesis Testing**:
- **Set up statistical power and effect size for the campaign.**
2. **Visualized data distributions to observe trends.**
3. **Computed the Z-score and compared it to the critical Z-score at a 5% significance level.**

- **Outcome**:
- **The analysis yielded a Z-score > Z-critical, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. 🎉**
- **This means the new credit card performed better than the old credit card, confirming its success!**
